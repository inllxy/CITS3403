> **Attention**  
> THE FOLDER STRUCTURE CHANGES FOR BETTER MAINTAINENCE, BEFORE SYNCING TO THIS VERSION,
> MAKE SURE YOUR CURRENT WORK DOESN'T DEPEND ON IT
> IF SO, BETTER DOWNLOAD THE CODE AND TEST IN A NEW WORKING PROJECT WITH YOUR WORK
> Also, feel free to make any adjustment to template as they're not flexible for datebase
